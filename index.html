                <hr class="light">
                <p class="text-faded">We are a handful of NIT Durgapur alumni who used to be associated with Questioning and Answering anything and everything under the sun and beneath the sea (with the small exception of Course Matter of course) and in turn satiating our curiosity and garnering a similar sentiment amongst the masses within the four walls of the college.</p>
                <p class="text-faded">Quizzing in that light – for us it was the propelling force behind our sustenance in college amidst mundane lectures and myriad assignments.</p>

                <hr class="light">
                <p class="text-faded">It was one of those quintessential post-quiz meet ups back in 2014 when the lot of us, sipping apple juice (which was of course fermented) and thinking hard, decided that our passion for quizzing and gaining & sharing knowledge should not be bogged down by our educational and corporate responsibilities – once we leave Engg. College. And Lo!! The concept for XQuizInc was sown, plucked and fermented in our brains that very night. Our college club being QuizInc; the X was to denote our past association with the club as well as denote the X –factor we aim to inculcate in ourselves as well as all quiz enthusiasts out there. And so after a hiatus of nearly a year, we collectively ascertained that the fermenting period was enough and the idea needs to be executed. And hence, we are happy to proclaim that XQuizInc is finally up and running – a new enterprise of the same old bunch of curious beings – “the cat might have been killed but thankfully we survived…..”

                <hr class="light">
                <p class="text-faded"> In that regard, we can boast of a widespread network of quizmasters stationed at locations throughout the length and breadth of the country. We work as a team but we do not believe in the concept that team work can only be accomplished by people sitting in together in the same room/building. So accessibility is not an issue any more and as we like to call it – your quizmaster is in your city itself; you just need to reach out to him. Through our online registration service, clients can register themselves and their requirements pertaining to the quizzes to be organized and we will automatically assign the quizmaster nearest to your location. This in turn, provides an excellent cost-cutting edge to the client as air fares and accommodation charges are reduced in gargantuan proportions. As for the content matter, whether it’s a school quiz or an Open Quiz – each and every question is thoroughly researched and churned out through collective brainstorming</p>
